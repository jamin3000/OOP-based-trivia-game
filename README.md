# OOP-based Trivia
Who was the first Australian-born Prime Minister of New Zealand? These facts and more in pub quiz trivia...

This is a simple OOP-experiment coded by myself with a bit of inspiration from a Python course I am taking. Enjoy. 

To be updated: create random pull of new questions to be generated in every initation. This is a bit difficult as existing libraries mostly pull boolean questions, instead of exact-answer statements. The best way to do this might be to scrape wikipages for answers using a seperate scraper.
